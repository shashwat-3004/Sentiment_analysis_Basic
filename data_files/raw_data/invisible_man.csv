"46",5230,"THE STRANGE MAN'S ARRIVAL"
"47",5230,""
"48",5230,""
"49",5230,"The stranger came early in February, one wintry day, through a"
"50",5230,"biting wind and a driving snow, the last snowfall of the year, over"
"51",5230,"the down, walking from Bramblehurst railway station, and carrying a"
"52",5230,"little black portmanteau in his thickly gloved hand. He was wrapped"
"53",5230,"up from head to foot, and the brim of his soft felt hat hid every"
"54",5230,"inch of his face but the shiny tip of his nose; the snow had piled"
"55",5230,"itself against his shoulders and chest, and added a white crest to"
"56",5230,"the burden he carried. He staggered into the ""Coach and Horses"" more"
"57",5230,"dead than alive, and flung his portmanteau down. ""A fire,"" he cried,"
"58",5230,"""in the name of human charity! A room and a fire!"" He stamped and"
"59",5230,"shook the snow from off himself in the bar, and followed Mrs. Hall"
"60",5230,"into her guest parlour to strike his bargain. And with that much"
"61",5230,"introduction, that and a couple of sovereigns flung upon the table,"
"62",5230,"he took up his quarters in the inn."
"63",5230,""
"64",5230,"Mrs. Hall lit the fire and left him there while she went to prepare"
"65",5230,"him a meal with her own hands. A guest to stop at Iping in the"
"66",5230,"wintertime was an unheard-of piece of luck, let alone a guest who"
"67",5230,"was no ""haggler,"" and she was resolved to show herself worthy of her"
"68",5230,"good fortune. As soon as the bacon was well under way, and Millie,"
"69",5230,"her lymphatic maid, had been brisked up a bit by a few deftly chosen"
"70",5230,"expressions of contempt, she carried the cloth, plates, and glasses"
"71",5230,"into the parlour and began to lay them with the utmost _eclat_."
"72",5230,"Although the fire was burning up briskly, she was surprised to see"
"73",5230,"that her visitor still wore his hat and coat, standing with his back"
"74",5230,"to her and staring out of the window at the falling snow in the yard."
"75",5230,"His gloved hands were clasped behind him, and he seemed to be lost"
"76",5230,"in thought. She noticed that the melting snow that still sprinkled"
"77",5230,"his shoulders dripped upon her carpet. ""Can I take your hat and coat,"
"78",5230,"sir?"" she said, ""and give them a good dry in the kitchen?"""
"79",5230,""
"80",5230,"""No,"" he said without turning."
"81",5230,""
"82",5230,"She was not sure she had heard him, and was about to repeat her"
"83",5230,"question."
"84",5230,""
"85",5230,"He turned his head and looked at her over his shoulder. ""I prefer to"
"86",5230,"keep them on,"" he said with emphasis, and she noticed that he wore"
"87",5230,"big blue spectacles with sidelights, and had a bush side-whisker"
"88",5230,"over his coat-collar that completely hid his cheeks and face."
"89",5230,""
"90",5230,"""Very well, sir,"" she said. ""_As_ you like. In a bit the room will"
"91",5230,"be warmer."""
"92",5230,""
"93",5230,"He made no answer, and had turned his face away from her again, and"
"94",5230,"Mrs. Hall, feeling that her conversational advances were ill-timed,"
"95",5230,"laid the rest of the table things in a quick staccato and whisked"
"96",5230,"out of the room. When she returned he was still standing there, like"
"97",5230,"a man of stone, his back hunched, his collar turned up, his dripping"
"98",5230,"hat-brim turned down, hiding his face and ears completely. She put"
"99",5230,"down the eggs and bacon with considerable emphasis, and called"
"100",5230,"rather than said to him, ""Your lunch is served, sir."""
"101",5230,""
"102",5230,"""Thank you,"" he said at the same time, and did not stir until she"
"103",5230,"was closing the door. Then he swung round and approached the table"
"104",5230,"with a certain eager quickness."
"105",5230,""
"106",5230,"As she went behind the bar to the kitchen she heard a sound repeated"
"107",5230,"at regular intervals. Chirk, chirk, chirk, it went, the sound of a"
"108",5230,"spoon being rapidly whisked round a basin. ""That girl!"" she said."
"109",5230,"""There! I clean forgot it. It's her being so long!"" And while she"
"110",5230,"herself finished mixing the mustard, she gave Millie a few verbal"
"111",5230,"stabs for her excessive slowness. She had cooked the ham and eggs,"
"112",5230,"laid the table, and done everything, while Millie (help indeed!) had"
"113",5230,"only succeeded in delaying the mustard. And him a new guest and"
"114",5230,"wanting to stay! Then she filled the mustard pot, and, putting it"
"115",5230,"with a certain stateliness upon a gold and black tea-tray, carried"
"116",5230,"it into the parlour."
"117",5230,""
"118",5230,"She rapped and entered promptly. As she did so her visitor moved"
"119",5230,"quickly, so that she got but a glimpse of a white object disappearing"
"120",5230,"behind the table. It would seem he was picking something from the"
"121",5230,"floor. She rapped down the mustard pot on the table, and then she"
"122",5230,"noticed the overcoat and hat had been taken off and put over a chair"
"123",5230,"in front of the fire, and a pair of wet boots threatened rust to her"
"124",5230,"steel fender. She went to these things resolutely. ""I suppose I may"
"125",5230,"have them to dry now,"" she said in a voice that brooked no denial."
"126",5230,""
"127",5230,"""Leave the hat,"" said her visitor, in a muffled voice, and turning"
"128",5230,"she saw he had raised his head and was sitting and looking at her."
"129",5230,""
"130",5230,"For a moment she stood gaping at him, too surprised to speak."
"131",5230,""
"132",5230,"He held a white cloth--it was a serviette he had brought with"
"133",5230,"him--over the lower part of his face, so that his mouth and jaws"
"134",5230,"were completely hidden, and that was the reason of his muffled"
"135",5230,"voice. But it was not that which startled Mrs. Hall. It was the fact"
"136",5230,"that all his forehead above his blue glasses was covered by a white"
"137",5230,"bandage, and that another covered his ears, leaving not a scrap of"
"138",5230,"his face exposed excepting only his pink, peaked nose. It was bright,"
"139",5230,"pink, and shiny just as it had been at first. He wore a dark-brown"
"140",5230,"velvet jacket with a high, black, linen-lined collar turned up about"
"141",5230,"his neck. The thick black hair, escaping as it could below and"
"142",5230,"between the cross bandages, projected in curious tails and horns,"
"143",5230,"giving him the strangest appearance conceivable. This muffled and"
"144",5230,"bandaged head was so unlike what she had anticipated, that for a"
"145",5230,"moment she was rigid."
"146",5230,""
"147",5230,"He did not remove the serviette, but remained holding it, as she"
"148",5230,"saw now, with a brown gloved hand, and regarding her with his"
"149",5230,"inscrutable blue glasses. ""Leave the hat,"" he said, speaking very"
"150",5230,"distinctly through the white cloth."
"151",5230,""
"152",5230,"Her nerves began to recover from the shock they had received. She"
"153",5230,"placed the hat on the chair again by the fire. ""I didn't know, sir,"""
"154",5230,"she began, ""that--"" and she stopped embarrassed."
"155",5230,""
"156",5230,"""Thank you,"" he said drily, glancing from her to the door and then"
"157",5230,"at her again."
"158",5230,""
"159",5230,"""I'll have them nicely dried, sir, at once,"" she said, and carried"
"160",5230,"his clothes out of the room. She glanced at his white-swathed head"
"161",5230,"and blue goggles again as she was going out of the door; but his"
"162",5230,"napkin was still in front of his face. She shivered a little as she"
"163",5230,"closed the door behind her, and her face was eloquent of her surprise"
"164",5230,"and perplexity. ""I _never_,"" she whispered. ""There!"" She went quite"
"165",5230,"softly to the kitchen, and was too preoccupied to ask Millie what"
"166",5230,"she was messing about with _now_, when she got there."
"167",5230,""
"168",5230,"The visitor sat and listened to her retreating feet. He glanced"
"169",5230,"inquiringly at the window before he removed his serviette, and"
"170",5230,"resumed his meal. He took a mouthful, glanced suspiciously at the"
"171",5230,"window, took another mouthful, then rose and, taking the serviette"
"172",5230,"in his hand, walked across the room and pulled the blind down to"
"173",5230,"the top of the white muslin that obscured the lower panes. This"
"174",5230,"left the room in a twilight. This done, he returned with an easier"
"175",5230,"air to the table and his meal."
"176",5230,""
"177",5230,"""The poor soul's had an accident or an op'ration or somethin',"" said"
"178",5230,"Mrs. Hall. ""What a turn them bandages did give me, to be sure!"""
"179",5230,""
"180",5230,"She put on some more coal, unfolded the clothes-horse, and extended"
"181",5230,"the traveller's coat upon this. ""And they goggles! Why, he looked"
"182",5230,"more like a divin' helmet than a human man!"" She hung his muffler"
"183",5230,"on a corner of the horse. ""And holding that handkerchief over his"
"184",5230,"mouth all the time. Talkin' through it! ... Perhaps his mouth was"
"185",5230,"hurt too--maybe."""
"186",5230,""
"187",5230,"She turned round, as one who suddenly remembers. ""Bless my soul"
"188",5230,"alive!"" she said, going off at a tangent; ""ain't you done them"
"189",5230,"taters _yet_, Millie?"""
"190",5230,""
"191",5230,"When Mrs. Hall went to clear away the stranger's lunch, her idea"
"192",5230,"that his mouth must also have been cut or disfigured in the accident"
"193",5230,"she supposed him to have suffered, was confirmed, for he was smoking"
"194",5230,"a pipe, and all the time that she was in the room he never loosened"
"195",5230,"the silk muffler he had wrapped round the lower part of his face to"
"196",5230,"put the mouthpiece to his lips. Yet it was not forgetfulness, for"
"197",5230,"she saw he glanced at it as it smouldered out. He sat in the corner"
"198",5230,"with his back to the window-blind and spoke now, having eaten and"
"199",5230,"drunk and being comfortably warmed through, with less aggressive"
"200",5230,"brevity than before. The reflection of the fire lent a kind of red"
"201",5230,"animation to his big spectacles they had lacked hitherto."
"202",5230,""
"203",5230,"""I have some luggage,"" he said, ""at Bramblehurst station,"" and he"
"204",5230,"asked her how he could have it sent. He bowed his bandaged head"
"205",5230,"quite politely in acknowledgment of her explanation. ""To-morrow?"" he"
"206",5230,"said. ""There is no speedier delivery?"" and seemed quite disappointed"
"207",5230,"when she answered, ""No."" Was she quite sure? No man with a trap who"
"208",5230,"would go over?"
"209",5230,""
"210",5230,"Mrs. Hall, nothing loath, answered his questions and developed a"
"211",5230,"conversation. ""It's a steep road by the down, sir,"" she said in"
"212",5230,"answer to the question about a trap; and then, snatching at an"
"213",5230,"opening, said, ""It was there a carriage was upsettled, a year ago"
"214",5230,"and more. A gentleman killed, besides his coachman. Accidents, sir,"
"215",5230,"happen in a moment, don't they?"""
"216",5230,""
"217",5230,"But the visitor was not to be drawn so easily. ""They do,"" he said"
"218",5230,"through his muffler, eyeing her quietly through his impenetrable"
"219",5230,"glasses."
"220",5230,""
"221",5230,"""But they take long enough to get well, don't they? ... There was"
"222",5230,"my sister's son, Tom, jest cut his arm with a scythe, tumbled on it"
"223",5230,"in the 'ayfield, and, bless me! he was three months tied up sir."
"224",5230,"You'd hardly believe it. It's regular given me a dread of a scythe,"
"225",5230,"sir."""
"226",5230,""
"227",5230,"""I can quite understand that,"" said the visitor."
"228",5230,""
"229",5230,"""He was afraid, one time, that he'd have to have an op'ration--he"
"230",5230,"was that bad, sir."""
"231",5230,""
"232",5230,"The visitor laughed abruptly, a bark of a laugh that he seemed to"
"233",5230,"bite and kill in his mouth. ""_Was_ he?"" he said."
"234",5230,""
"235",5230,"""He was, sir. And no laughing matter to them as had the doing for"
"236",5230,"him, as I had--my sister being took up with her little ones so"
"237",5230,"much. There was bandages to do, sir, and bandages to undo. So that"
"238",5230,"if I may make so bold as to say it, sir--"""
"239",5230,""
"240",5230,"""Will you get me some matches?"" said the visitor, quite abruptly."
"241",5230,"""My pipe is out."""
"242",5230,""
"243",5230,"Mrs. Hall was pulled up suddenly. It was certainly rude of him,"
"244",5230,"after telling him all she had done. She gasped at him for a moment,"
"245",5230,"and remembered the two sovereigns. She went for the matches."
"246",5230,""
"247",5230,"""Thanks,"" he said concisely, as she put them down, and turned his"
"248",5230,"shoulder upon her and stared out of the window again. It was"
"249",5230,"altogether too discouraging. Evidently he was sensitive on the"
"250",5230,"topic of operations and bandages. She did not ""make so bold as to"
"251",5230,"say,"" however, after all. But his snubbing way had irritated her,"
"252",5230,"and Millie had a hot time of it that afternoon."
"253",5230,""
"254",5230,"The visitor remained in the parlour until four o'clock, without"
"255",5230,"giving the ghost of an excuse for an intrusion. For the most part"
"256",5230,"he was quite still during that time; it would seem he sat in the"
"257",5230,"growing darkness smoking in the firelight--perhaps dozing."
"258",5230,""
"259",5230,"Once or twice a curious listener might have heard him at the coals,"
"260",5230,"and for the space of five minutes he was audible pacing the room."
"261",5230,"He seemed to be talking to himself. Then the armchair creaked as"
"262",5230,"he sat down again."
"263",5230,""
"264",5230,""
"265",5230,""
"266",5230,"CHAPTER II"
"267",5230,""
"268",5230,"MR. TEDDY HENFREY'S FIRST IMPRESSIONS"
"269",5230,""
"270",5230,""
"271",5230,"At four o'clock, when it was fairly dark and Mrs. Hall was screwing"
"272",5230,"up her courage to go in and ask her visitor if he would take some"
"273",5230,"tea, Teddy Henfrey, the clock-jobber, came into the bar. ""My sakes!"
"274",5230,"Mrs. Hall,"" said he, ""but this is terrible weather for thin boots!"""
"275",5230,"The snow outside was falling faster."
"276",5230,""
"277",5230,"Mrs. Hall agreed, and then noticed he had his bag with him. ""Now"
"278",5230,"you're here, Mr. Teddy,"" said she, ""I'd be glad if you'd give th'"
"279",5230,"old clock in the parlour a bit of a look. 'Tis going, and it strikes"
"280",5230,"well and hearty; but the hour-hand won't do nuthin' but point at"
"281",5230,"six."""
"282",5230,""
"283",5230,"And leading the way, she went across to the parlour door and rapped"
"284",5230,"and entered."
"285",5230,""
"286",5230,"Her visitor, she saw as she opened the door, was seated in the"
"287",5230,"armchair before the fire, dozing it would seem, with his bandaged"
"288",5230,"head drooping on one side. The only light in the room was the red"
"289",5230,"glow from the fire--which lit his eyes like adverse railway signals,"
"290",5230,"but left his downcast face in darkness--and the scanty vestiges of"
"291",5230,"the day that came in through the open door. Everything was ruddy,"
"292",5230,"shadowy, and indistinct to her, the more so since she had just been"
"293",5230,"lighting the bar lamp, and her eyes were dazzled. But for a second"
"294",5230,"it seemed to her that the man she looked at had an enormous mouth"
"295",5230,"wide open--a vast and incredible mouth that swallowed the whole of"
"296",5230,"the lower portion of his face. It was the sensation of a moment:"
"297",5230,"the white-bound head, the monstrous goggle eyes, and this huge yawn"
"298",5230,"below it. Then he stirred, started up in his chair, put up his hand."
"299",5230,"She opened the door wide, so that the room was lighter, and she saw"
"300",5230,"him more clearly, with the muffler held up to his face just as she"
"301",5230,"had seen him hold the serviette before. The shadows, she fancied,"
"302",5230,"had tricked her."
"303",5230,""
"304",5230,"""Would you mind, sir, this man a-coming to look at the clock, sir?"""
"305",5230,"she said, recovering from the momentary shock."
"306",5230,""
"307",5230,"""Look at the clock?"" he said, staring round in a drowsy manner,"
"308",5230,"and speaking over his hand, and then, getting more fully awake,"
"309",5230,"""certainly."""
"310",5230,""
"311",5230,"Mrs. Hall went away to get a lamp, and he rose and stretched"
"312",5230,"himself. Then came the light, and Mr. Teddy Henfrey, entering, was"
"313",5230,"confronted by this bandaged person. He was, he says, ""taken aback."""
"314",5230,""
"315",5230,"""Good afternoon,"" said the stranger, regarding him--as Mr. Henfrey"
"316",5230,"says, with a vivid sense of the dark spectacles--""like a lobster."""
"317",5230,""
"318",5230,"""I hope,"" said Mr. Henfrey, ""that it's no intrusion."""
"319",5230,""
"320",5230,"""None whatever,"" said the stranger. ""Though, I understand,"" he said"
"321",5230,"turning to Mrs. Hall, ""that this room is really to be mine for my"
"322",5230,"own private use."""
"323",5230,""
"324",5230,"""I thought, sir,"" said Mrs. Hall, ""you'd prefer the clock--"""
"325",5230,""
"326",5230,"""Certainly,"" said the stranger, ""certainly--but, as a rule, I"
"327",5230,"like to be alone and undisturbed."
"328",5230,""
"329",5230,"""But I'm really glad to have the clock seen to,"" he said, seeing a"
"330",5230,"certain hesitation in Mr. Henfrey's manner. ""Very glad."" Mr. Henfrey"
"331",5230,"had intended to apologise and withdraw, but this anticipation"
"332",5230,"reassured him. The stranger turned round with his back to the"
"333",5230,"fireplace and put his hands behind his back. ""And presently,"" he"
"334",5230,"said, ""when the clock-mending is over, I think I should like to"
"335",5230,"have some tea. But not till the clock-mending is over."""
"336",5230,""
"337",5230,"Mrs. Hall was about to leave the room--she made no conversational"
"338",5230,"advances this time, because she did not want to be snubbed in front"
"339",5230,"of Mr. Henfrey--when her visitor asked her if she had made any"
"340",5230,"arrangements about his boxes at Bramblehurst. She told him she had"
"341",5230,"mentioned the matter to the postman, and that the carrier could"
"342",5230,"bring them over on the morrow. ""You are certain that is the"
"343",5230,"earliest?"" he said."
"344",5230,""
"345",5230,"She was certain, with a marked coldness."
"346",5230,""
"347",5230,"""I should explain,"" he added, ""what I was really too cold and"

"387",5230,"and upon the frame and wheels, and left the rest of the room"
"388",5230,"shadowy. When he looked up, coloured patches swam in his eyes."
"389",5230,"Being constitutionally of a curious nature, he had removed the"

"392",5230,"But the stranger stood there, perfectly silent and still. So still,"
"393",5230,"it got on Henfrey's nerves. He felt alone in the room and looked up,"

"456",5230,"in a manner not to the point. But the seed of suspicion Teddy"
"457",5230,"had sown germinated in the mind of Mr. Hall in spite of these"
"458",5230,"discouragements. ""You wim' don't know everything,"" said Mr. Hall,"
"459",5230,"resolved to ascertain more about the personality of his guest at"
"460",5230,"the earliest possible opportunity. And after the stranger had gone"
"461",5230,"to bed, which he did about half-past nine, Mr. Hall went very"
"462",5230,"aggressively into the parlour and looked very hard at his wife's"
"463",5230,"furniture, just to show that the stranger wasn't master there,"
"464",5230,"and scrutinised closely and a little contemptuously a sheet of"
"465",5230,"mathematical computations the stranger had left. When retiring"
"466",5230,"for the night he instructed Mrs. Hall to look very closely at"

"487",5230,"So it was that on the twenty-ninth day of February, at the beginning"
"488",5230,"of the thaw, this singular person fell out of infinity into Iping"
"489",5230,"village. Next day his luggage arrived through the slush--and very"
"490",5230,"remarkable luggage it was. There were a couple of trunks indeed,"
"491",5230,"such as a rational man might need, but in addition there were"
"492",5230,"a box of books--big, fat books, of which some were just in an"
"493",5230,"incomprehensible handwriting--and a dozen or more crates, boxes,"
"494",5230,"and cases, containing objects packed in straw, as it seemed to"
"495",5230,"Hall, tugging with a casual curiosity at the straw--glass bottles."
"496",5230,"The stranger, muffled in hat, coat, gloves, and wrapper, came out"
"497",5230,"impatiently to meet Fearenside's cart, while Hall was having a word"
"498",5230,"or so of gossip preparatory to helping bring them in. Out he came,"
"499",5230,"not noticing Fearenside's dog, who was sniffing in a _dilettante_"

"501",5230,"""I've been waiting long enough."""
"502",5230,""

"505",5230,""
"506",5230,"No sooner had Fearenside's dog caught sight of him, however, than"

"508",5230,"steps it gave an undecided hop, and then sprang straight at his"
"509",5230,"hand. ""Whup!"" cried Hall, jumping back, for he was no hero with"
"510",5230,"dogs, and Fearenside howled, ""Lie down!"" and snatched his whip."

"512",5230,"They saw the dog's teeth had slipped the hand, heard a kick, saw the"
"513",5230,"dog execute a flanking jump and get home on the stranger's leg, and"
"514",5230,"heard the rip of his trousering. Then the finer end of Fearenside's"
"515",5230,"whip reached his property, and the dog, yelping with dismay,"
"516",5230,"retreated under the wheels of the waggon. It was all the business of"
"517",5230,"a swift half-minute. No one spoke, everyone shouted. The stranger"
"518",5230,"glanced swiftly at his torn glove and at his leg, made as if he"
"519",5230,"would stoop to the latter, then turned and rushed swiftly up the"
"520",5230,"steps into the inn. They heard him go headlong across the passage"
"521",5230,"and up the uncarpeted stairs to his bedroom."
"522",5230,""
"523",5230,"""You brute, you!"" said Fearenside, climbing off the waggon with his"

"538",5230,"face of a pale pansy. Then he was struck violently in the chest,"

"540",5230,"rapid that it gave him no time to observe. A waving of indecipherable"

"544",5230,"A couple of minutes after, he rejoined the little group that had"

"585",5230,"straw with an utter disregard of Mrs. Hall's carpet. And from it he"
"586",5230,"began to produce bottles--little fat bottles containing powders,"

"591",5230,"corks, bottles with bungs, bottles with wooden caps, wine bottles,"

"593",5230,"mantel, on the table under the window, round the floor, on the"
"594",5230,"bookshelf--everywhere. The chemist's shop in Bramblehurst could not"
"595",5230,"boast half so many. Quite a sight it was. Crate after crate yielded"
"596",5230,"bottles, until all six were empty and the table high with straw; the"

"598",5230,"a number of test-tubes and a carefully packed balance."

"610",5230,"half turned his head and immediately turned it away again. But she"
"611",5230,"saw he had removed his glasses; they were beside him on the table,"
"612",5230,"and it seemed to her that his eye sockets were extraordinarily"
"613",5230,"hollow. He put on his spectacles again, and then turned and faced"

"693",5230,"and the colour's come off patchy instead of mixing. I've heard of"

"701",5230,"MR. CUSS INTERVIEWS THE STRANGER"
"702",5230,""
"703",5230,""
"704",5230,"I have told the circumstances of the stranger's arrival in Iping"
"705",5230,"with a certain fulness of detail, in order that the curious"
"706",5230,"impression he created may be understood by the reader. But"
"707",5230,"excepting two odd incidents, the circumstances of his stay until"
"708",5230,"the extraordinary day of the club festival may be passed over very"
"709",5230,"cursorily. There were a number of skirmishes with Mrs. Hall on"
"710",5230,"matters of domestic discipline, but in every case until late April,"
"711",5230,"when the first signs of penury began, he over-rode her by the easy"
"712",5230,"expedient of an extra payment. Hall did not like him, and whenever"
"713",5230,"he dared he talked of the advisability of getting rid of him; but"
"714",5230,"he showed his dislike chiefly by concealing it ostentatiously, and"
"715",5230,"avoiding his visitor as much as possible. ""Wait till the summer,"""
"716",5230,"said Mrs. Hall sagely, ""when the artisks are beginning to come."
"717",5230,"Then we'll see. He may be a bit overbearing, but bills settled"
"718",5230,"punctual is bills settled punctual, whatever you'd like to say."""
"719",5230,""
"720",5230,"The stranger did not go to church, and indeed made no difference"
"721",5230,"between Sunday and the irreligious days, even in costume. He"
"722",5230,"worked, as Mrs. Hall thought, very fitfully. Some days he would"
"723",5230,"come down early and be continuously busy. On others he would rise"
"724",5230,"late, pace his room, fretting audibly for hours together, smoke,"
"725",5230,"sleep in the armchair by the fire. Communication with the world"
"726",5230,"beyond the village he had none. His temper continued very"
"727",5230,"uncertain; for the most part his manner was that of a man suffering"
"728",5230,"under almost unendurable provocation, and once or twice things were"
"729",5230,"snapped, torn, crushed, or broken in spasmodic gusts of violence."
"730",5230,"He seemed under a chronic irritation of the greatest intensity. His"
"731",5230,"habit of talking to himself in a low voice grew steadily upon him,"
"732",5230,"but though Mrs. Hall listened conscientiously she could make"
"733",5230,"neither head nor tail of what she heard."
"734",5230,""
"735",5230,"He rarely went abroad by daylight, but at twilight he would go out"
"736",5230,"muffled up invisibly, whether the weather were cold or not, and he"
"737",5230,"chose the loneliest paths and those most overshadowed by trees and"
"738",5230,"banks. His goggling spectacles and ghastly bandaged face under the"
"739",5230,"penthouse of his hat, came with a disagreeable suddenness out of"
"740",5230,"the darkness upon one or two home-going labourers, and Teddy"
"741",5230,"Henfrey, tumbling out of the ""Scarlet Coat"" one night, at half-past"
"742",5230,"nine, was scared shamefully by the stranger's skull-like head (he"
"743",5230,"was walking hat in hand) lit by the sudden light of the opened inn"
"744",5230,"door. Such children as saw him at nightfall dreamt of bogies, and"
"745",5230,"it seemed doubtful whether he disliked boys more than they disliked"
"746",5230,"him, or the reverse; but there was certainly a vivid enough dislike"
"747",5230,"on either side."
"748",5230,""
"749",5230,"It was inevitable that a person of so remarkable an appearance and"
"750",5230,"bearing should form a frequent topic in such a village as Iping."
"751",5230,"Opinion was greatly divided about his occupation. Mrs. Hall was"
"752",5230,"sensitive on the point. When questioned, she explained very"
"753",5230,"carefully that he was an ""experimental investigator,"" going"
"754",5230,"gingerly over the syllables as one who dreads pitfalls. When asked"
"755",5230,"what an experimental investigator was, she would say with a touch"
"756",5230,"of superiority that most educated people knew such things as that,"
"757",5230,"and would thus explain that he ""discovered things."" Her visitor had"
"758",5230,"had an accident, she said, which temporarily discoloured his face"
"759",5230,"and hands, and being of a sensitive disposition, he was averse to"
"760",5230,"any public notice of the fact."
"761",5230,""
"762",5230,"Out of her hearing there was a view largely entertained that he was"
"763",5230,"a criminal trying to escape from justice by wrapping himself up so"
"764",5230,"as to conceal himself altogether from the eye of the police. This"
"765",5230,"idea sprang from the brain of Mr. Teddy Henfrey. No crime of any"
"766",5230,"magnitude dating from the middle or end of February was known to"
"767",5230,"have occurred. Elaborated in the imagination of Mr. Gould, the"
"768",5230,"probationary assistant in the National School, this theory took the"
"769",5230,"form that the stranger was an Anarchist in disguise, preparing"
"770",5230,"explosives, and he resolved to undertake such detective operations"
"771",5230,"as his time permitted. These consisted for the most part in looking"
"772",5230,"very hard at the stranger whenever they met, or in asking people"
"773",5230,"who had never seen the stranger, leading questions about him. But"
"774",5230,"he detected nothing."
"775",5230,""
"776",5230,"Another school of opinion followed Mr. Fearenside, and either"
"777",5230,"accepted the piebald view or some modification of it; as, for"
"778",5230,"instance, Silas Durgan, who was heard to assert that ""if he chooses"
"779",5230,"to show enself at fairs he'd make his fortune in no time,"" and"
"780",5230,"being a bit of a theologian, compared the stranger to the man with"
"781",5230,"the one talent. Yet another view explained the entire matter by"
"782",5230,"regarding the stranger as a harmless lunatic. That had the"
"783",5230,"advantage of accounting for everything straight away."
"784",5230,""
"785",5230,"Between these main groups there were waverers and compromisers."
"786",5230,"Sussex folk have few superstitions, and it was only after the"
"787",5230,"events of early April that the thought of the supernatural was"
"788",5230,"first whispered in the village. Even then it was only credited"
"789",5230,"among the women folk."
"790",5230,""
"791",5230,"But whatever they thought of him, people in Iping, on the whole,"
"792",5230,"agreed in disliking him. His irritability, though it might have"
"793",5230,"been comprehensible to an urban brain-worker, was an amazing thing"
"794",5230,"to these quiet Sussex villagers. The frantic gesticulations they"
"795",5230,"surprised now and then, the headlong pace after nightfall that"
"796",5230,"swept him upon them round quiet corners, the inhuman bludgeoning"
"797",5230,"of all tentative advances of curiosity, the taste for twilight"
"798",5230,"that led to the closing of doors, the pulling down of blinds,"
"799",5230,"the extinction of candles and lamps--who could agree with such"
"800",5230,"goings on? They drew aside as he passed down the village, and when"
"801",5230,"he had gone by, young humourists would up with coat-collars and"
"802",5230,"down with hat-brims, and go pacing nervously after him in imitation"
"803",5230,"of his occult bearing. There was a song popular at that time called"
"804",5230,"""The Bogey Man"". Miss Statchell sang it at the schoolroom concert"
"805",5230,"(in aid of the church lamps), and thereafter whenever one or two of"
"806",5230,"the villagers were gathered together and the stranger appeared, a"
"807",5230,"bar or so of this tune, more or less sharp or flat, was whistled in"
"808",5230,"the midst of them. Also belated little children would call ""Bogey"
"809",5230,"Man!"" after him, and make off tremulously elated."
"810",5230,""
"811",5230,"Cuss, the general practitioner, was devoured by curiosity. The"
"812",5230,"bandages excited his professional interest, the report of the"
"813",5230,"thousand and one bottles aroused his jealous regard. All through"
"814",5230,"April and May he coveted an opportunity of talking to the stranger,"
"815",5230,"and at last, towards Whitsuntide, he could stand it no longer, but"
"816",5230,"hit upon the subscription-list for a village nurse as an excuse. He"
"817",5230,"was surprised to find that Mr. Hall did not know his guest's name."
"818",5230,"""He give a name,"" said Mrs. Hall--an assertion which was quite"
"819",5230,"unfounded--""but I didn't rightly hear it."" She thought it seemed"
"820",5230,"so silly not to know the man's name."
"821",5230,""
"822",5230,"Cuss rapped at the parlour door and entered. There was a fairly"
"823",5230,"audible imprecation from within. ""Pardon my intrusion,"" said Cuss,"
"824",5230,"and then the door closed and cut Mrs. Hall off from the rest of"
"825",5230,"the conversation."
"826",5230,""
"827",5230,"She could hear the murmur of voices for the next ten minutes, then"
"828",5230,"a cry of surprise, a stirring of feet, a chair flung aside, a bark"
"829",5230,"of laughter, quick steps to the door, and Cuss appeared, his face"
"830",5230,"white, his eyes staring over his shoulder. He left the door open"
"831",5230,"behind him, and without looking at her strode across the hall and"
"832",5230,"went down the steps, and she heard his feet hurrying along the"
"833",5230,"road. He carried his hat in his hand. She stood behind the door,"
"834",5230,"looking at the open door of the parlour. Then she heard the"
"835",5230,"stranger laughing quietly, and then his footsteps came across the"
"836",5230,"room. She could not see his face where she stood. The parlour door"
"837",5230,"slammed, and the place was silent again."
"838",5230,""
"839",5230,"Cuss went straight up the village to Bunting the vicar. ""Am I mad?"""
"840",5230,"Cuss began abruptly, as he entered the shabby little study. ""Do I"
"841",5230,"look like an insane person?"""
"842",5230,""
"843",5230,"""What's happened?"" said the vicar, putting the ammonite on the"

"848",5230,"""Well?"""
"849",5230,""
"850",5230,"""Give me something to drink,"" said Cuss, and he sat down."
"851",5230,""
"852",5230,"When his nerves had been steadied by a glass of cheap sherry--the"
"853",5230,"only drink the good vicar had available--he told him of the"
"854",5230,"interview he had just had. ""Went in,"" he gasped, ""and began to"
"855",5230,"demand a subscription for that Nurse Fund. He'd stuck his hands in"
"856",5230,"his pockets as I came in, and he sat down lumpily in his chair."
"857",5230,"Sniffed. I told him I'd heard he took an interest in scientific"
"858",5230,"things. He said yes. Sniffed again. Kept on sniffing all the time;"
"859",5230,"evidently recently caught an infernal cold. No wonder, wrapped up"
"860",5230,"like that! I developed the nurse idea, and all the while kept my"
"861",5230,"eyes open. Bottles--chemicals--everywhere. Balance, test-tubes"
"862",5230,"in stands, and a smell of--evening primrose. Would he subscribe?"
"863",5230,"Said he'd consider it. Asked him, point-blank, was he researching."
"864",5230,"Said he was. A long research? Got quite cross. 'A damnable long"
"865",5230,"research,' said he, blowing the cork out, so to speak. 'Oh,' said"
"866",5230,"I. And out came the grievance. The man was just on the boil, and my"
"867",5230,"question boiled him over. He had been given a prescription, most"
"868",5230,"valuable prescription--what for he wouldn't say. Was it medical?"
"869",5230,"'Damn you! What are you fishing after?' I apologised. Dignified"
"870",5230,"sniff and cough. He resumed. He'd read it. Five ingredients. Put it"
"871",5230,"down; turned his head. Draught of air from window lifted the paper."
"872",5230,"Swish, rustle. He was working in a room with an open fireplace, he"
"873",5230,"said. Saw a flicker, and there was the prescription burning and"
"874",5230,"lifting chimneyward. Rushed towards it just as it whisked up the"
"875",5230,"chimney. So! Just at that point, to illustrate his story, out came"
"876",5230,"his arm."""
"877",5230,""

"879",5230,""
"880",5230,"""No hand--just an empty sleeve. Lord! I thought, _that's_ a"

"882",5230,"thought, there's something odd in that. What the devil keeps that"
"883",5230,"sleeve up and open, if there's nothing in it? There was nothing in"

"890",5230,"""Well?"""
"891",5230,""
"892",5230,"""That's all. He never said a word; just glared, and put his sleeve"

"901",5230,"didn't flinch, though I'm hanged if that bandaged knob of his, and"

"945",5230,"THE BURGLARY AT THE VICARAGE"
"946",5230,""
"947",5230,""
"948",5230,"The facts of the burglary at the vicarage came to us chiefly"
"949",5230,"through the medium of the vicar and his wife. It occurred in the"
"950",5230,"small hours of Whit Monday, the day devoted in Iping to the Club"
"951",5230,"festivities. Mrs. Bunting, it seems, woke up suddenly in the"
"952",5230,"stillness that comes before the dawn, with the strong impression"
"953",5230,"that the door of their bedroom had opened and closed. She did not"
"954",5230,"arouse her husband at first, but sat up in bed listening. She then"
"955",5230,"distinctly heard the pad, pad, pad of bare feet coming out of the"
"956",5230,"adjoining dressing-room and walking along the passage towards the"
"957",5230,"staircase. As soon as she felt assured of this, she aroused the"
"958",5230,"Rev. Mr. Bunting as quietly as possible. He did not strike a light,"
"959",5230,"but putting on his spectacles, her dressing-gown and his bath"
"960",5230,"slippers, he went out on the landing to listen. He heard quite"
"961",5230,"distinctly a fumbling going on at his study desk down-stairs, and"
"962",5230,"then a violent sneeze."
"963",5230,""
"964",5230,"At that he returned to his bedroom, armed himself with the most"
"965",5230,"obvious weapon, the poker, and descended the staircase as"
"966",5230,"noiselessly as possible. Mrs. Bunting came out on the landing."
"967",5230,""
"968",5230,"The hour was about four, and the ultimate darkness of the night was"
"969",5230,"past. There was a faint shimmer of light in the hall, but the study"
"970",5230,"doorway yawned impenetrably black. Everything was still except the"
"971",5230,"faint creaking of the stairs under Mr. Bunting's tread, and the"
"972",5230,"slight movements in the study. Then something snapped, the drawer"
"973",5230,"was opened, and there was a rustle of papers. Then came an"
"974",5230,"imprecation, and a match was struck and the study was flooded with"
"975",5230,"yellow light. Mr. Bunting was now in the hall, and through the"
"976",5230,"crack of the door he could see the desk and the open drawer and a"
"977",5230,"candle burning on the desk. But the robber he could not see. He"
"978",5230,"stood there in the hall undecided what to do, and Mrs. Bunting, her"
"979",5230,"face white and intent, crept slowly downstairs after him. One thing"
"980",5230,"kept Mr. Bunting's courage; the persuasion that this burglar was a"
"981",5230,"resident in the village."
"982",5230,""
"983",5230,"They heard the chink of money, and realised that the robber had"
"984",5230,"found the housekeeping reserve of gold--two pounds ten in half"
"985",5230,"sovereigns altogether. At that sound Mr. Bunting was nerved to"
"986",5230,"abrupt action. Gripping the poker firmly, he rushed into the room,"
"987",5230,"closely followed by Mrs. Bunting. ""Surrender!"" cried Mr. Bunting,"
"988",5230,"fiercely, and then stooped amazed. Apparently the room was"
"989",5230,"perfectly empty."
"990",5230,""
"991",5230,"Yet their conviction that they had, that very moment, heard somebody"

"993",5230,"perhaps, they stood gaping, then Mrs. Bunting went across the room"
"994",5230,"and looked behind the screen, while Mr. Bunting, by a kindred"
"995",5230,"impulse, peered under the desk. Then Mrs. Bunting turned back the"
"996",5230,"window-curtains, and Mr. Bunting looked up the chimney and probed it"
"997",5230,"with the poker. Then Mrs. Bunting scrutinised the waste-paper basket"
"998",5230,"and Mr. Bunting opened the lid of the coal-scuttle. Then they came"

"1045",5230,"Hall found she had forgotten to bring down a bottle of sarsaparilla"

"1056",5230,"the stranger's room upstairs and the suggestions of Mr. Teddy"
"1057",5230,"Henfrey. He distinctly remembered holding the candle while Mrs."
"1058",5230,"Hall shot these bolts overnight. At the sight he stopped, gaping,"

"1850",5230,"on the supposition that he had quite gone away, and with the"
"1851",5230,"sceptics he was already a jest. But people, sceptics and believers"

"1856",5230,"children ran races and played games under the noisy guidance of the"
"1857",5230,"curate and the Misses Cuss and Sackbut. No doubt there was a slight"
"1858",5230,"uneasiness in the air, but people for the most part had the sense"

"1861",5230,"the while to a pulley-swung handle, one could be hurled violently against"
"1862",5230,"a sack at the other end, came in for considerable favour among the"
"1863",5230,"adolescents, as also did the swings and the cocoanut shies. There"
"1864",5230,"was also promenading, and the steam organ attached to a small"
"1865",5230,"roundabout filled the air with a pungent flavour of oil and with"
"1866",5230,"equally pungent music. Members of the club, who had attended"
"1867",5230,"church in the morning, were splendid in badges of pink and green,"
"1868",5230,"and some of the gayer-minded had also adorned their bowler hats"

"1871",5230,"jasmine about his window or through the open door (whichever way"
"1872",5230,"you chose to look), poised delicately on a plank supported on two"
"1873",5230,"chairs, and whitewashing the ceiling of his front room."

"1875",5230,"About four o'clock a stranger entered the village from the direction"

"1878",5230,"cheeks were alternately limp and tightly puffed. His mottled face"

"1891",5230,"he marched up the steps, and was seen by Mr. Huxter to turn to the"
"1892",5230,"left and open the door of the parlour. Mr. Huxter heard voices from"

"1903",5230,"the gate-posts, produced a short clay pipe, and prepared to fill"
"1904",5230,"it. His fingers trembled while doing so. He lit it clumsily, and"

"1914",5230,"conceiving he was witness of some petty larceny, leapt round his"
"1915",5230,"counter and ran out into the road to intercept the thief. As he did"
"1916",5230,"so, Mr. Marvel reappeared, his hat askew, a big bundle in a blue"
"1917",5230,"table-cloth in one hand, and three books tied together--as it proved"
"1918",5230,"afterwards with the Vicar's braces--in the other. Directly he saw"
"1919",5230,"Huxter he gave a sort of gasp, and turning sharply to the left,"
"1920",5230,"began to run. ""Stop, thief!"" cried Huxter, and set off after him."

"1922",5230,"before him and spurting briskly for the church corner and the hill"
"1923",5230,"road. He saw the village flags and festivities beyond, and a face or"
"1924",5230,"so turned towards him. He bawled, ""Stop!"" again. He had hardly gone"
"1925",5230,"ten strides before his shin was caught in some mysterious fashion,"
"1926",5230,"and he was no longer running, but flying with inconceivable rapidity"
"1927",5230,"through the air. He saw the ground suddenly close to his face. The"

"3546",5230,""
"3547",5230,"""Precisely,"" said Griffin. ""But consider, visibility depends on the"
"3548",5230,"action of the visible bodies on light. Either a body absorbs light,"
"3549",5230,"or it reflects or refracts it, or does all these things. If it"
"3550",5230,"neither reflects nor refracts nor absorbs light, it cannot of"
"3551",5230,"itself be visible. You see an opaque red box, for instance, because"
"3552",5230,"the colour absorbs some of the light and reflects the rest, all the"
"3553",5230,"red part of the light, to you. If it did not absorb any particular"
"3554",5230,"part of the light, but reflected it all, then it would be a shining"
"3555",5230,"white box. Silver! A diamond box would neither absorb much of the"
"3556",5230,"light nor reflect much from the general surface, but just here"
"3557",5230,"and there where the surfaces were favourable the light would"
"3558",5230,"be reflected and refracted, so that you would get a brilliant"
"3559",5230,"appearance of flashing reflections and translucencies--a sort of"
"3560",5230,"skeleton of light. A glass box would not be so brilliant, nor so"
"3561",5230,"clearly visible, as a diamond box, because there would be less"
"3562",5230,"refraction and reflection. See that? From certain points of view"
"3563",5230,"you would see quite clearly through it. Some kinds of glass would"
"3564",5230,"be more visible than others, a box of flint glass would be brighter"
"3565",5230,"than a box of ordinary window glass. A box of very thin common"
"3566",5230,"glass would be hard to see in a bad light, because it would absorb"
"3567",5230,"hardly any light and refract and reflect very little. And if you"
"3568",5230,"put a sheet of common white glass in water, still more if you"
"3569",5230,"put it in some denser liquid than water, it would vanish almost"
"3570",5230,"altogether, because light passing from water to glass is only"
"3571",5230,"slightly refracted or reflected or indeed affected in any way."
"3572",5230,"It is almost as invisible as a jet of coal gas or hydrogen is in"
"3573",5230,"air. And for precisely the same reason!"""
"3574",5230,""
"3575",5230,"""Yes,"" said Kemp, ""that is pretty plain sailing."""
"3576",5230,""
"3577",5230,"""And here is another fact you will know to be true. If a sheet of"

"3580",5230,"white powder. This is because the powdering multiplies the surfaces"
"3581",5230,"of the glass at which refraction and reflection occur. In the sheet"
"3582",5230,"of glass there are only two surfaces; in the powder the light is"
"3583",5230,"reflected or refracted by each grain it passes through, and very"
"3584",5230,"little gets right through the powder. But if the white powdered"
"3585",5230,"glass is put into water, it forthwith vanishes. The powdered glass"
"3586",5230,"and water have much the same refractive index; that is, the light"
"3587",5230,"undergoes very little refraction or reflection in passing from one"
"3588",5230,"to the other."
"3589",5230,""
"3590",5230,"""You make the glass invisible by putting it into a liquid of nearly"

"3592",5230,"it is put in any medium of almost the same refractive index. And if"
"3593",5230,"you will consider only a second, you will see also that the powder"
"3594",5230,"of glass might be made to vanish in air, if its refractive index"
"3595",5230,"could be made the same as that of air; for then there would be no"
"3596",5230,"refraction or reflection as the light passed from glass to air."""

"3607",5230,"of transparent fibres, and it is white and opaque only for the same"
"3608",5230,"reason that a powder of glass is white and opaque. Oil white paper,"
"3609",5230,"fill up the interstices between the particles with oil so that there"
"3610",5230,"is no longer refraction or reflection except at the surfaces, and"

"4077",5230,"a man carrying a basket of soda-water syphons, and looking in"

"4079",5230,"found something so irresistible in his astonishment that I laughed"
"4080",5230,"aloud. 'The devil's in the basket,' I said, and suddenly twisted"

"4102",5230,"forthwith the shaft of a crawling hansom dug me forcibly under the"

"4296",5230,"marched doorward. And then a number of brisk young men began with"
"4297",5230,"remarkable alacrity to tidy up the goods that remained disturbed. I"
"4298",5230,"left my lair as the crowds diminished, and prowled cautiously out"
"4299",5230,"into the less desolate parts of the shop. I was really surprised to"
"4300",5230,"observe how rapidly the young men and women whipped away the goods"
"4301",5230,"displayed for sale during the day. All the boxes of goods, the"
"4302",5230,"hanging fabrics, the festoons of lace, the boxes of sweets in the"

"4305",5230,"could not be taken down and put away had sheets of some coarse"
"4306",5230,"stuff like sacking flung over them. Finally all the chairs were"

"4315",5230,"hour or more after the shop had been closed, came a noise of"

"4327",5230,"out what I sought; the box label called them lambswool pants, and"

"4356",5230,"and the wrinkled old woman's gnarled face as she asked for her cat."
"4357",5230,"I experienced again the strange sensation of seeing the cloth"
"4358",5230,"disappear, and so I came round to the windy hillside and the"
"4359",5230,"sniffing old clergyman mumbling 'Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,"
"4360",5230,"dust to dust,' at my father's open grave."
"4361",5230,""
"4362",5230,"""'You also,' said a voice, and suddenly I was being forced towards"

"4364",5230,"continued stonily following the service; the old clergyman, too,"
"4365",5230,"never faltered droning and sniffing through the ritual. I realised"
"4366",5230,"I was invisible and inaudible, that overwhelming forces had their"
"4367",5230,"grip on me. I struggled in vain, I was forced over the brink, the"
"4368",5230,"coffin rang hollow as I fell upon it, and the gravel came flying"
"4369",5230,"after me in spadefuls. Nobody heeded me, nobody was aware of me. I"

"4375",5230,"its counters, its piles of rolled stuff, its heap of quilts and"
"4376",5230,"cushions, its iron pillars, might be. Then, as recollection came"

"4384",5230,"'Who's that?' cried one, and 'Stop there!' shouted the other. I"
"4385",5230,"dashed around a corner and came full tilt--a faceless figure,"
"4386",5230,"mind you!--on a lanky lad of fifteen. He yelled and I bowled him"
"4387",5230,"over, rushed past him, turned another corner, and by a happy"

"4389",5230,"went running past and I heard voices shouting, 'All hands to the"

"4411",5230,"shouting and footsteps running from all parts. I made a mad rush"
"4412",5230,"for the refreshment place, and there was a man in white like a man"

"4672",5230,""
"4673",5230,"""I was hungry. Downstairs I found a loaf and some rank cheese--more"

"4677",5230,"upon the street, two lace curtains brown with dirt guarding the"

"4679",5230,"the day was bright--by contrast with the brown shadows of the"
"4680",5230,"dismal house in which I found myself, dazzlingly bright. A brisk"
"4681",5230,"traffic was going by, fruit carts, a hansom, a four-wheeler with a"
"4682",5230,"pile of boxes, a fishmonger's cart. I turned with spots of colour"
"4683",5230,"swimming before my eyes to the shadowy fixtures behind me. My"
"4684",5230,"excitement was giving place to a clear apprehension of my position"
"4685",5230,"again. The room was full of a faint scent of benzoline, used, I"

"4687",5230,""
"4688",5230,"""I began a systematic search of the place. I should judge the"

"4691",5230,"I collected in the clothes storeroom, and then I made a deliberate"

"4698",5230,"turpentine and other appliances and a considerable amount of time"
"4699",5230,"before I could vanish again. Finally I chose a mask of the better"
"4700",5230,"type, slightly grotesque but not more so than many human beings,"
"4701",5230,"dark glasses, greyish whiskers, and a wig. I could find no"

"4704",5230,"could find no socks, but the hunchback's boots were rather a loose"
"4705",5230,"fit and sufficed. In a desk in the shop were three sovereigns and"
"4706",5230,"about thirty shillings' worth of silver, and in a locked cupboard I"

"5108",5230,""
"5109",5230,"The Invisible Man seems to have rushed out of Kemp's house in a"
"5110",5230,"state of blind fury. A little child playing near Kemp's gateway was"
"5111",5230,"violently caught up and thrown aside, so that its ankle was broken,"
"5112",5230,"and thereafter for some hours the Invisible Man passed out of human"
"5113",5230,"perceptions. No one knows where he went nor what he did. But one"
"5114",5230,"can imagine him hurrying through the hot June forenoon, up the"
"5115",5230,"hill and on to the open downland behind Port Burdock, raging and"

"5117",5230,"and weary, amid the thickets of Hintondean, to piece together again"
"5118",5230,"his shattered schemes against his species. That seems the most"
"5119",5230,"probable refuge for him, for there it was he re-asserted himself in"
"5120",5230,"a grimly tragical manner about two in the afternoon."
"5121",5230,""
"5122",5230,"One wonders what his state of mind may have been during that time,"
"5123",5230,"and what plans he devised. No doubt he was almost ecstatically"
"5124",5230,"exasperated by Kemp's treachery, and though we may be able to"
"5125",5230,"understand the motives that led to that deceit, we may still"
"5126",5230,"imagine and even sympathise a little with the fury the attempted"
"5127",5230,"surprise must have occasioned. Perhaps something of the stunned"
"5128",5230,"astonishment of his Oxford Street experiences may have returned to"
"5129",5230,"him, for he had evidently counted on Kemp's co-operation in his"
"5130",5230,"brutal dream of a terrorised world. At any rate he vanished from"
"5131",5230,"human ken about midday, and no living witness can tell what he did"
"5132",5230,"until about half-past two. It was a fortunate thing, perhaps, for"
"5133",5230,"humanity, but for him it was a fatal inaction."
"5134",5230,""
"5135",5230,"During that time a growing multitude of men scattered over the"
"5136",5230,"countryside were busy. In the morning he had still been simply a"
"5137",5230,"legend, a terror; in the afternoon, by virtue chiefly of Kemp's"
"5138",5230,"drily worded proclamation, he was presented as a tangible"
"5139",5230,"antagonist, to be wounded, captured, or overcome, and the"
"5140",5230,"countryside began organising itself with inconceivable rapidity."
"5141",5230,"By two o'clock even he might still have removed himself out of"
"5142",5230,"the district by getting aboard a train, but after two that became"
"5143",5230,"impossible. Every passenger train along the lines on a great"
"5144",5230,"parallelogram between Southampton, Manchester, Brighton and Horsham,"
"5145",5230,"travelled with locked doors, and the goods traffic was almost"
"5146",5230,"entirely suspended. And in a great circle of twenty miles round Port"
"5147",5230,"Burdock, men armed with guns and bludgeons were presently setting"
"5148",5230,"out in groups of three and four, with dogs, to beat the roads and"
"5149",5230,"fields."
"5150",5230,""
"5151",5230,"Mounted policemen rode along the country lanes, stopping at every"
"5152",5230,"cottage and warning the people to lock up their houses, and keep"
"5153",5230,"indoors unless they were armed, and all the elementary schools had"
"5154",5230,"broken up by three o'clock, and the children, scared and keeping"
"5155",5230,"together in groups, were hurrying home. Kemp's proclamation--signed"
"5156",5230,"indeed by Adye--was posted over almost the whole district by four or"
"5157",5230,"five o'clock in the afternoon. It gave briefly but clearly all the"
"5158",5230,"conditions of the struggle, the necessity of keeping the Invisible"
"5159",5230,"Man from food and sleep, the necessity for incessant watchfulness"
"5160",5230,"and for a prompt attention to any evidence of his movements. And"
"5161",5230,"so swift and decided was the action of the authorities, so prompt"
"5162",5230,"and universal was the belief in this strange being, that before"
"5163",5230,"nightfall an area of several hundred square miles was in a stringent"
"5164",5230,"state of siege. And before nightfall, too, a thrill of horror"
"5165",5230,"went through the whole watching nervous countryside. Going from"
"5166",5230,"whispering mouth to mouth, swift and certain over the length and"
"5167",5230,"breadth of the country, passed the story of the murder of Mr."
"5168",5230,"Wicksteed."
"5169",5230,""
"5170",5230,"If our supposition that the Invisible Man's refuge was the"
"5171",5230,"Hintondean thickets, then we must suppose that in the early"
"5172",5230,"afternoon he sallied out again bent upon some project that involved"
"5173",5230,"the use of a weapon. We cannot know what the project was, but the"
"5174",5230,"evidence that he had the iron rod in hand before he met Wicksteed"
"5175",5230,"is to me at least overwhelming."
"5176",5230,""
"5177",5230,"Of course we can know nothing of the details of that encounter."
"5178",5230,"It occurred on the edge of a gravel pit, not two hundred yards"
"5179",5230,"from Lord Burdock's lodge gate. Everything points to a desperate"
"5180",5230,"struggle--the trampled ground, the numerous wounds Mr. Wicksteed"
"5181",5230,"received, his splintered walking-stick; but why the attack was made,"
"5182",5230,"save in a murderous frenzy, it is impossible to imagine. Indeed the"
"5183",5230,"theory of madness is almost unavoidable. Mr. Wicksteed was a man of"
"5184",5230,"forty-five or forty-six, steward to Lord Burdock, of inoffensive"
"5185",5230,"habits and appearance, the very last person in the world to provoke"
"5186",5230,"such a terrible antagonist. Against him it would seem the Invisible"
"5187",5230,"Man used an iron rod dragged from a broken piece of fence. He"
"5188",5230,"stopped this quiet man, going quietly home to his midday meal,"
"5189",5230,"attacked him, beat down his feeble defences, broke his arm, felled"
"5190",5230,"him, and smashed his head to a jelly."
"5191",5230,""
"5192",5230,"Of course, he must have dragged this rod out of the fencing before"
"5193",5230,"he met his victim--he must have been carrying it ready in his hand."
"5194",5230,"Only two details beyond what has already been stated seem to bear"
"5195",5230,"on the matter. One is the circumstance that the gravel pit was not"
"5196",5230,"in Mr. Wicksteed's direct path home, but nearly a couple of hundred"
"5197",5230,"yards out of his way. The other is the assertion of a little girl"
"5198",5230,"to the effect that, going to her afternoon school, she saw the"
"5199",5230,"murdered man ""trotting"" in a peculiar manner across a field towards"
"5200",5230,"the gravel pit. Her pantomime of his action suggests a man pursuing"
"5201",5230,"something on the ground before him and striking at it ever and"
"5202",5230,"again with his walking-stick. She was the last person to see him"
"5203",5230,"alive. He passed out of her sight to his death, the struggle being"
"5204",5230,"hidden from her only by a clump of beech trees and a slight"
"5205",5230,"depression in the ground."
"5206",5230,""
"5207",5230,"Now this, to the present writer's mind at least, lifts the murder"
"5208",5230,"out of the realm of the absolutely wanton. We may imagine that"
"5209",5230,"Griffin had taken the rod as a weapon indeed, but without any"
"5210",5230,"deliberate intention of using it in murder. Wicksteed may then have"
"5211",5230,"come by and noticed this rod inexplicably moving through the air."
"5212",5230,"Without any thought of the Invisible Man--for Port Burdock is ten"
"5213",5230,"miles away--he may have pursued it. It is quite conceivable that"
"5214",5230,"he may not even have heard of the Invisible Man. One can then"
"5215",5230,"imagine the Invisible Man making off--quietly in order to avoid"
"5216",5230,"discovering his presence in the neighbourhood, and Wicksteed,"
"5217",5230,"excited and curious, pursuing this unaccountably locomotive"
"5218",5230,"object--finally striking at it."
"5219",5230,""
"5220",5230,"No doubt the Invisible Man could easily have distanced his"
"5221",5230,"middle-aged pursuer under ordinary circumstances, but the position"
"5222",5230,"in which Wicksteed's body was found suggests that he had the"
"5223",5230,"ill luck to drive his quarry into a corner between a drift of"
"5224",5230,"stinging nettles and the gravel pit. To those who appreciate the"
"5225",5230,"extraordinary irascibility of the Invisible Man, the rest of the"
"5226",5230,"encounter will be easy to imagine."
"5227",5230,""
"5228",5230,"But this is pure hypothesis. The only undeniable facts--for stories"
"5229",5230,"of children are often unreliable--are the discovery of Wicksteed's"
"5230",5230,"body, done to death, and of the blood-stained iron rod flung among"
"5231",5230,"the nettles. The abandonment of the rod by Griffin, suggests that"
"5232",5230,"in the emotional excitement of the affair, the purpose for which"
"5233",5230,"he took it--if he had a purpose--was abandoned. He was certainly"
"5234",5230,"an intensely egotistical and unfeeling man, but the sight of his"
"5235",5230,"victim, his first victim, bloody and pitiful at his feet, may have"
"5236",5230,"released some long pent fountain of remorse which for a time may"
"5237",5230,"have flooded whatever scheme of action he had contrived."
"5238",5230,""
"5239",5230,"After the murder of Mr. Wicksteed, he would seem to have struck"
"5240",5230,"across the country towards the downland. There is a story of a"
"5241",5230,"voice heard about sunset by a couple of men in a field near Fern"
"5242",5230,"Bottom. It was wailing and laughing, sobbing and groaning, and ever"
"5243",5230,"and again it shouted. It must have been queer hearing. It drove up"
"5244",5230,"across the middle of a clover field and died away towards the"
"5245",5230,"hills."
"5246",5230,""
"5247",5230,"That afternoon the Invisible Man must have learnt something of"
"5248",5230,"the rapid use Kemp had made of his confidences. He must have"
"5249",5230,"found houses locked and secured; he may have loitered about"
"5250",5230,"railway stations and prowled about inns, and no doubt he read the"
"5251",5230,"proclamations and realised something of the nature of the campaign"
"5252",5230,"against him. And as the evening advanced, the fields became dotted"
"5253",5230,"here and there with groups of three or four men, and noisy with the"
"5254",5230,"yelping of dogs. These men-hunters had particular instructions in"
"5255",5230,"the case of an encounter as to the way they should support one"
"5256",5230,"another. But he avoided them all. We may understand something of"
"5257",5230,"his exasperation, and it could have been none the less because"
"5258",5230,"he himself had supplied the information that was being used so"
"5259",5230,"remorselessly against him. For that day at least he lost heart; for"
"5260",5230,"nearly twenty-four hours, save when he turned on Wicksteed, he was"
"5261",5230,"a hunted man. In the night, he must have eaten and slept; for in"
"5262",5230,"the morning he was himself again, active, powerful, angry, and"
"5263",5230,"malignant, prepared for his last great struggle against the world."

"5511",5230,"threw up his hands and fell forward on his face, leaving a little"
"5512",5230,"puff of blue in the air. Kemp did not hear the sound of the shot."

"5519",5230,"chasing each other through the shrubbery between the house and the"
"5520",5230,"road gate. Adye lay on the lawn near the gate. The blinds of all"
"5521",5230,"the villas down the hill-road were drawn, but in one little green"

"5529",5230,"had locked themselves into their rooms. This was followed by a"
"5530",5230,"silence. Kemp sat listening and then began peering cautiously out"
"5531",5230,"of the three windows, one after another. He went to the staircase"
"5532",5230,"head and stood listening uneasily. He armed himself with his"
"5533",5230,"bedroom poker, and went to examine the interior fastenings of the"
"5534",5230,"ground-floor windows again. Everything was safe and quiet. He"
"5535",5230,"returned to the belvedere. Adye lay motionless over the edge of the"

"5545",5230,"of the iron fastenings of the shutters. He turned the key and"
"5546",5230,"opened the kitchen door. As he did so, the shutters, split and"
"5547",5230,"splintering, came flying inward. He stood aghast. The window frame,"
"5548",5230,"save for one crossbar, was still intact, but only little teeth of"
"5549",5230,"glass remained in the frame. The shutters had been driven in with"
"5550",5230,"an axe, and now the axe was descending in sweeping blows upon the"
"5551",5230,"window frame and the iron bars defending it. Then suddenly it leapt"
"5552",5230,"aside and vanished. He saw the revolver lying on the path outside,"
"5553",5230,"and then the little weapon sprang into the air. He dodged back. The"
"5554",5230,"revolver cracked just too late, and a splinter from the edge of the"
"5555",5230,"closing door flashed over his head. He slammed and locked the door,"
"5556",5230,"and as he stood outside he heard Griffin shouting and laughing."

"5677",5230,"""I could have sworn it was all right""--he looked at his watch--""twenty"
"5678",5230,"minutes ago."""
"5679",5230,""
"5680",5230,"He became aware of a measured concussion and the clash of glass,"
"5681",5230,"far away in the distance. And then, as he sat open-mouthed, came a"
"5682",5230,"still more wonderful thing. The shutters of the drawing-room window"
"5683",5230,"were flung open violently, and the housemaid in her outdoor hat and"
"5684",5230,"garments, appeared struggling in a frantic manner to throw up the"
"5685",5230,"sash. Suddenly a man appeared beside her, helping her--Dr. Kemp!"
"5686",5230,"In another moment the window was open, and the housemaid was"
"5687",5230,"struggling out; she pitched forward and vanished among the shrubs."
"5688",5230,"Mr. Heelas stood up, exclaiming vaguely and vehemently at all these"
"5689",5230,"wonderful things. He saw Kemp stand on the sill, spring from the"
"5690",5230,"window, and reappear almost instantaneously running along a path in"
"5691",5230,"the shrubbery and stooping as he ran, like a man who evades"
"5692",5230,"observation. He vanished behind a laburnum, and appeared again"
"5693",5230,"clambering over a fence that abutted on the open down. In a second"
"5694",5230,"he had tumbled over and was running at a tremendous pace down the"
"5695",5230,"slope towards Mr. Heelas."
"5696",5230,""
"5697",5230,"""Lord!"" cried Mr. Heelas, struck with an idea; ""it's that Invisible"
"5698",5230,"Man brute! It's right, after all!"""
"5699",5230,""
"5700",5230,"With Mr. Heelas to think things like that was to act, and his cook"
"5701",5230,"watching him from the top window was amazed to see him come pelting"
"5702",5230,"towards the house at a good nine miles an hour. There was a"
"5703",5230,"slamming of doors, a ringing of bells, and the voice of Mr. Heelas"
"5704",5230,"bellowing like a bull. ""Shut the doors, shut the windows, shut"
"5705",5230,"everything!--the Invisible Man is coming!"" Instantly the house was"
"5706",5230,"full of screams and directions, and scurrying feet. He ran himself"
"5707",5230,"to shut the French windows that opened on the veranda; as he did so"
"5708",5230,"Kemp's head and shoulders and knee appeared over the edge of the"
"5709",5230,"garden fence. In another moment Kemp had ploughed through the"
"5710",5230,"asparagus, and was running across the tennis lawn to the house."
"5711",5230,""
"5712",5230,"""You can't come in,"" said Mr. Heelas, shutting the bolts. ""I'm very"
"5713",5230,"sorry if he's after you, but you can't come in!"""
"5714",5230,""
"5715",5230,"Kemp appeared with a face of terror close to the glass, rapping and"
"5716",5230,"then shaking frantically at the French window. Then, seeing his"
"5717",5230,"efforts were useless, he ran along the veranda, vaulted the end,"
"5718",5230,"and went to hammer at the side door. Then he ran round by the side"
"5719",5230,"gate to the front of the house, and so into the hill-road. And Mr."
"5720",5230,"Heelas staring from his window--a face of horror--had scarcely"
"5721",5230,"witnessed Kemp vanish, ere the asparagus was being trampled this"
"5722",5230,"way and that by feet unseen. At that Mr. Heelas fled precipitately"
"5723",5230,"upstairs, and the rest of the chase is beyond his purview. But as"
"5724",5230,"he passed the staircase window, he heard the side gate slam."
"5725",5230,""
"5726",5230,"Emerging into the hill-road, Kemp naturally took the downward"
"5727",5230,"direction, and so it was he came to run in his own person the very"
"5728",5230,"race he had watched with such a critical eye from the belvedere"
"5729",5230,"study only four days ago. He ran it well, for a man out of"
"5730",5230,"training, and though his face was white and wet, his wits were cool"
"5731",5230,"to the last. He ran with wide strides, and wherever a patch of"
"5732",5230,"rough ground intervened, wherever there came a patch of raw flints,"
"5733",5230,"or a bit of broken glass shone dazzling, he crossed it and left the"
"5734",5230,"bare invisible feet that followed to take what line they would."
"5735",5230,""
"5736",5230,"For the first time in his life Kemp discovered that the hill-road"
"5737",5230,"was indescribably vast and desolate, and that the beginnings of the"
"5738",5230,"town far below at the hill foot were strangely remote. Never had"
"5739",5230,"there been a slower or more painful method of progression than"
"5740",5230,"running. All the gaunt villas, sleeping in the afternoon sun,"
"5741",5230,"looked locked and barred; no doubt they were locked and barred--by"
"5742",5230,"his own orders. But at any rate they might have kept a lookout"
"5743",5230,"for an eventuality like this! The town was rising up now, the sea"
"5744",5230,"had dropped out of sight behind it, and people down below were"
"5745",5230,"stirring. A tram was just arriving at the hill foot. Beyond that"
"5746",5230,"was the police station. Was that footsteps he heard behind him?"
"5747",5230,"Spurt."
"5748",5230,""
"5749",5230,"The people below were staring at him, one or two were running, and"
"5750",5230,"his breath was beginning to saw in his throat. The tram was quite"
"5751",5230,"near now, and the ""Jolly Cricketers"" was noisily barring its doors."
"5752",5230,"Beyond the tram were posts and heaps of gravel--the drainage"
"5753",5230,"works. He had a transitory idea of jumping into the tram and"
"5754",5230,"slamming the doors, and then he resolved to go for the police"
"5755",5230,"station. In another moment he had passed the door of the ""Jolly"
"5756",5230,"Cricketers,"" and was in the blistering fag end of the street, with"
"5757",5230,"human beings about him. The tram driver and his helper--arrested"
"5758",5230,"by the sight of his furious haste--stood staring with the tram"
"5759",5230,"horses unhitched. Further on the astonished features of navvies"
"5760",5230,"appeared above the mounds of gravel."
"5761",5230,""
"5762",5230,"His pace broke a little, and then he heard the swift pad of his"
"5763",5230,"pursuer, and leapt forward again. ""The Invisible Man!"" he cried to"
"5764",5230,"the navvies, with a vague indicative gesture, and by an inspiration"
"5765",5230,"leapt the excavation and placed a burly group between him and the"
"5766",5230,"chase. Then abandoning the idea of the police station he turned"
"5767",5230,"into a little side street, rushed by a greengrocer's cart,"
"5768",5230,"hesitated for the tenth of a second at the door of a sweetstuff"
"5769",5230,"shop, and then made for the mouth of an alley that ran back into"
"5770",5230,"the main Hill Street again. Two or three little children were"
"5771",5230,"playing here, and shrieked and scattered at his apparition, and"
"5772",5230,"forthwith doors and windows opened and excited mothers revealed"
"5773",5230,"their hearts. Out he shot into Hill Street again, three hundred"
"5774",5230,"yards from the tram-line end, and immediately he became aware of a"
"5775",5230,"tumultuous vociferation and running people."
"5776",5230,""
"5777",5230,"He glanced up the street towards the hill. Hardly a dozen yards off"
"5778",5230,"ran a huge navvy, cursing in fragments and slashing viciously with"
"5779",5230,"a spade, and hard behind him came the tram conductor with his fists"
"5780",5230,"clenched. Up the street others followed these two, striking and"
"5781",5230,"shouting. Down towards the town, men and women were running, and he"
"5782",5230,"noticed clearly one man coming out of a shop-door with a stick in"
"5783",5230,"his hand. ""Spread out! Spread out!"" cried some one. Kemp suddenly"
"5784",5230,"grasped the altered condition of the chase. He stopped, and looked"
"5785",5230,"round, panting. ""He's close here!"" he cried. ""Form a line across--"""
"5786",5230,""
"5787",5230,"He was hit hard under the ear, and went reeling, trying to face"
"5788",5230,"round towards his unseen antagonist. He just managed to keep his"
"5789",5230,"feet, and he struck a vain counter in the air. Then he was hit"
"5790",5230,"again under the jaw, and sprawled headlong on the ground. In"
"5791",5230,"another moment a knee compressed his diaphragm, and a couple of"
"5792",5230,"eager hands gripped his throat, but the grip of one was weaker than"
"5793",5230,"the other; he grasped the wrists, heard a cry of pain from his"
"5794",5230,"assailant, and then the spade of the navvy came whirling through"
"5795",5230,"the air above him, and struck something with a dull thud. He felt"
"5796",5230,"a drop of moisture on his face. The grip at his throat suddenly"
"5797",5230,"relaxed, and with a convulsive effort, Kemp loosed himself, grasped"
"5798",5230,"a limp shoulder, and rolled uppermost. He gripped the unseen elbows"
"5799",5230,"near the ground. ""I've got him!"" screamed Kemp. ""Help! Help--hold!"
"5800",5230,"He's down! Hold his feet!"""
"5801",5230,""
"5802",5230,"In another second there was a simultaneous rush upon the struggle,"
"5803",5230,"and a stranger coming into the road suddenly might have thought an"
"5804",5230,"exceptionally savage game of Rugby football was in progress. And"
"5805",5230,"there was no shouting after Kemp's cry--only a sound of blows"
"5806",5230,"and feet and heavy breathing."
"5807",5230,""
"5808",5230,"Then came a mighty effort, and the Invisible Man threw off a couple"
"5809",5230,"of his antagonists and rose to his knees. Kemp clung to him in"
"5810",5230,"front like a hound to a stag, and a dozen hands gripped, clutched,"
"5811",5230,"and tore at the Unseen. The tram conductor suddenly got the neck"
"5812",5230,"and shoulders and lugged him back."
"5813",5230,""
"5814",5230,"Down went the heap of struggling men again and rolled over. There"
"5815",5230,"was, I am afraid, some savage kicking. Then suddenly a wild scream"
"5816",5230,"of ""Mercy! Mercy!"" that died down swiftly to a sound like choking."
"5817",5230,""
"5818",5230,"""Get back, you fools!"" cried the muffled voice of Kemp, and there"
"5819",5230,"was a vigorous shoving back of stalwart forms. ""He's hurt, I tell"
"5820",5230,"you. Stand back!"""
"5821",5230,""
"5822",5230,"There was a brief struggle to clear a space, and then the circle of"
"5823",5230,"eager faces saw the doctor kneeling, as it seemed, fifteen inches"
"5824",5230,"in the air, and holding invisible arms to the ground. Behind him a"
"5825",5230,"constable gripped invisible ankles."
"5826",5230,""
"5827",5230,"""Don't you leave go of en,"" cried the big navvy, holding a"
"5828",5230,"blood-stained spade; ""he's shamming."""
"5829",5230,""
"5830",5230,"""He's not shamming,"" said the doctor, cautiously raising his knee;"
"5831",5230,"""and I'll hold him."" His face was bruised and already going red; he"
"5832",5230,"spoke thickly because of a bleeding lip. He released one hand and"
"5833",5230,"seemed to be feeling at the face. ""The mouth's all wet,"" he said."
"5834",5230,"And then, ""Good God!"""
"5835",5230,""
"5836",5230,"He stood up abruptly and then knelt down on the ground by the side"
"5837",5230,"of the thing unseen. There was a pushing and shuffling, a sound of"
"5838",5230,"heavy feet as fresh people turned up to increase the pressure of"
"5839",5230,"the crowd. People now were coming out of the houses. The doors of"
"5840",5230,"the ""Jolly Cricketers"" stood suddenly wide open. Very little was said."
"5841",5230,""
"5842",5230,"Kemp felt about, his hand seeming to pass through empty air. ""He's"
"5843",5230,"not breathing,"" he said, and then, ""I can't feel his heart. His"
"5844",5230,"side--ugh!"""
"5845",5230,""
"5846",5230,"Suddenly an old woman, peering under the arm of the big navvy,"
"5847",5230,"screamed sharply. ""Looky there!"" she said, and thrust out a"
"5848",5230,"wrinkled finger."
"5849",5230,""
"5850",5230,"And looking where she pointed, everyone saw, faint and transparent"
"5851",5230,"as though it was made of glass, so that veins and arteries and"
"5852",5230,"bones and nerves could be distinguished, the outline of a hand, a"
"5853",5230,"hand limp and prone. It grew clouded and opaque even as they stared."
"5854",5230,""
"5855",5230,"""Hullo!"" cried the constable. ""Here's his feet a-showing!"""
"5856",5230,""
"5857",5230,"And so, slowly, beginning at his hands and feet and creeping along"
"5858",5230,"his limbs to the vital centres of his body, that strange change"
"5859",5230,"continued. It was like the slow spreading of a poison. First came"
"5860",5230,"the little white nerves, a hazy grey sketch of a limb, then the"
"5861",5230,"glassy bones and intricate arteries, then the flesh and skin, first"
"5862",5230,"a faint fogginess, and then growing rapidly dense and opaque."
"5863",5230,"Presently they could see his crushed chest and his shoulders, and"
"5864",5230,"the dim outline of his drawn and battered features."
"5865",5230,""
"5866",5230,"When at last the crowd made way for Kemp to stand erect, there lay,"
"5867",5230,"naked and pitiful on the ground, the bruised and broken body of a"
"5868",5230,"young man about thirty. His hair and brow were white--not grey"
"5869",5230,"with age, but white with the whiteness of albinism--and his eyes"
"5870",5230,"were like garnets. His hands were clenched, his eyes wide open, and"
"5871",5230,"his expression was one of anger and dismay."
"5872",5230,""
"5873",5230,"""Cover his face!"" said a man. ""For Gawd's sake, cover that face!"""
"5874",5230,"and three little children, pushing forward through the crowd, were"
"5875",5230,"suddenly twisted round and sent packing off again."
"5876",5230,""
"5877",5230,"Someone brought a sheet from the ""Jolly Cricketers,"" and having"
"5878",5230,"covered him, they carried him into that house. And there it was, on"
"5879",5230,"a shabby bed in a tawdry, ill-lighted bedroom, surrounded by a crowd"
"5880",5230,"of ignorant and excited people, broken and wounded, betrayed and"
"5881",5230,"unpitied, that Griffin, the first of all men to make himself"
"5882",5230,"invisible, Griffin, the most gifted physicist the world has ever"

"5892",5230,"little inn near Port Stowe and talk to the landlord. The sign of"
"5893",5230,"the inn is an empty board save for a hat and boots, and the name is"
"5894",5230,"the title of this story. The landlord is a short and corpulent"
"5895",5230,"little man with a nose of cylindrical proportions, wiry hair, and a"
"5896",5230,"sporadic rosiness of visage. Drink generously, and he will tell you"
"5897",5230,"generously of all the things that happened to him after that time,"
"5898",5230,"and of how the lawyers tried to do him out of the treasure found"

"5910",5230,"with asseverations that everybody thinks _he_ has 'em! But bless you!"

"5915",5230,"And then he subsides into a pensive state, watches you furtively,"

"5921",5230,"of braces for example, he still turns to string. He conducts his"
"5922",5230,"house without enterprise, but with eminent decorum. His movements"
"5923",5230,"are slow, and he is a great thinker. But he has a reputation for"
"5924",5230,"wisdom and for a respectable parsimony in the village, and his"

"5932",5230,"being satisfied of his solitude, he unlocks the cupboard and a box"
"5933",5230,"in the cupboard and a drawer in that box, and produces three"
"5934",5230,"volumes bound in brown leather, and places them solemnly in the"

"5936",5230,"algal green--for once they sojourned in a ditch and some of the"
"5937",5230,"pages have been washed blank by dirty water. The landlord sits down"
"5938",5230,"in an armchair, fills a long clay pipe slowly--gloating over the"
"5939",5230,"books the while. Then he pulls one towards him and opens it, and"
